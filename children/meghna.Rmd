Okay, so now that we see how we can use manipulate, lets try out an example that shows why manipulate is such a great package! To do this, we will directly contrast its easy use with an exercise we did in class, where we used ShinyApp instead. 

First, let us load the asean_tourism dataset into our RStudio. It contains the tourism numbers for a range of countries from the year 2004 to 2015. In Tutorial 21, we were asked to create a barplot of the tourism values for each country. We also created a dropdown menu with the different years as options. Overall, this allowed us to view the tourism values of any year we wanted. 

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("children/images/meghna_img1.png")
```

This was the code we used. Complicated, right? ShinyApp has a lot of advantages, but while it is useful, it tends to be computationally complex. So how do we do something similar using Manipulate?

First, lets recall that picker variables are a feature of the manipulate package. So we type the following code: 

```{r}
# Prepare the data. 
asean_tourism <- read.csv("data/asean_tourism.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(asean_tourism)[1] <- "country"
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(manipulate)
library(ggplot2)

manipulate(
  ggplot(asean_tourism, aes_string("country", paste("X", year, sep=""), fill="country")) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
    theme(legend.position="none",
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, 
                                     vjust = 0.5,
                                     hjust = 1)),
  year = picker(as.list(c(2004:2015)))
)

```
So in our code, what we did was assign a variable to the picker function -- the function being years. In my opinion, this package is useful for data manipulation. So, for example, if we were to toggle through the years: all throughout 2004-2013, Brunei's tourism numbers do not cross 500. But then in the years 2013-2014, we see a sudden spike in tourism to almost 2500! That's a hike of more than 5 times! So, if you were doing say an economics capstone, you'd be interested to know why there was a hike. Were there any policy changes between 2013-14? If so, is it worth analyzing? How significant is this spike in tourism number? 

See! This is why Manipulate is so handy - it allows for preliminary data exploration so you can decide what variables/data is easy to work with. Of course, once I know what variables I want to work with: its best to use shinyApp to publish my results. But until then, this is a user-friendly tool for you to work with. 

Let's look at the shinyApp code we used in class again: 

The direct benefits are that our code (that you probably have typed up by now if you were following this) is a lot less complicated. 

1. manipulate is a single function, whereas shinyApp has 2 functions: its ui and server specifications. P

2. But also, on a functional level: shinyApp is more concerned with layout. Our shinyApp code creates a beautifully spaced barplot, with a nice drop-down menu. Manipulate on the other hand is just for the data analyst's use. There's no helptext, no titlepanel, etc. This makes it convenient in the short run, but a lot less aesthetic. 

3. The UI refers to generated by Server side, and the server side assigns an output to a name. Worrying about the mapping can get tedious, and in my humble R experience - leads to several errors that require debugging. Then again, ShinyApp is designed that way because we may have several outputs that need referring to, so of course there are its benefits of being complicated. 

All in all though, this package is convenient and effective for getting the job done when it comes to sorting data according to its varying categories - and we hope we've proved its use!
